## Key Benefits for Developers & LLMs

-  **Semantic & Interactive Extraction:** Parses beyond raw HTML, prioritizing headings, text, lists, tables, forms, and media. Captures interactive elements and their attributes.
-  **LLM Context Optimization:** Returns a simplified, flattened JSON output, minimizing token count for cost-effective LLM usage.
-  **Structured & Chunkable Output:** Provides a well-organized JSON structure, easily divisible into meaningful chunks for vector embeddings, Markdown conversion, or further processing.

## Core Features

-  **DOM to Structured JSON:** Transforms complex webpage DOMs into clean, simplified JSON.
-  **Interactive Element Capture:** Extracts data from buttons, inputs, forms, and other interactive components.
-  **Table Parsing:** Specifically handles table extraction with headers and rows.
